# Working with Shapefile via Python

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to demonstrating a simple and efficient way to load and work with shapefiles using Python. It is intended for those who are interested in geospatial analysis and want to leverage Python's powerful libraries to handle geographic data.

## Installation
Before you begin, ensure that you have GeoPandas installed, as it is crucial for working with shapefiles in Python. GeoPandas is an open-source project that makes working with geospatial data in python easier. It extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.

You can install GeoPandas using pip:

```bash
pip install geopandas
